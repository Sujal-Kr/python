Python supports Gui
to execute Gui objects on .One of the major library is Tkiner.
This library provides the facility to create any type of gui Obbject.
The Most Common object are Label box text box message box window menu bar Tables List box 
label box is used to display any text on the screen .We can't make any changes in the label box .
A label box can work as a button for event handlings.


From the Kinter library we  have to create an object for Tk class(Tkiner Kit).
This object provides the basic rule for other Objects Such as Label,textBox etc.
From the tk Object we can call any of the member with dot operator eg:tk.label()
Whatever the Gui Object we are creating tp displays the object we need the pack funciton .
The root canvas will execute with the help of mainloop function .
